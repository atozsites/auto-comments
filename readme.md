Bring the best conversation to the top of the page with atozsites Comments.

== Description ==
Comments can be the best part of a post. So why are they always buried?

atozsites comments uses language analysis and machine learning to identify the most relevant and thoughtful comment on each of your posts. The comment is then automatically inserted near the top of the post as a simple sidebar pull quote. 

== Installation ==
atozsites comments is quite simple. Once activated, it will run automatically. It does not affect your old posts, you will only notice it our new posts and comments moving forward.

After a new post receives more than three comments the best will automatically be chosen and displayed at about 1/3 of the way through the post.

There are a few options available:

= Enable or disable atozsites comments =
Visit Settings > atozsites Comments in order to set the default behaviour to insert atozsites comments automatically or not.

= Manually place the comment =
Comments can be manually placed on posts by using the following shortcode:
[atozsites-comment]

= Disable comment elevation per post =
If you would like to disable comment elevation on a post you can do so using a checkbox on the Discussion Settings metabox on the Edit Post screen.


== Screenshots ==
1. The best comment from a post is automatically determined by magical robots and placed into the post content about 1/3 of the way down the page.
2. A checkbox on the Discussion Settings metabox allows you to enable or disable atozsites comments per post
3. Or, use a shortcode to place the atozsites comment manually.
